      <h4>
          “YAY!!” I shouted. I had solved one of the hardest things for the first time! Even if it took me 2 months I will still take it as a reward. I used the site ruwix 3x3 to help me solve my Rubix cube. After I solved my cube I was shocked to see it solved because I only see Rubix cubes solved in videos or when the cube is newly opened from the box.
My dad mixed up the cube again. It took me an hour to solve but it was progress.I practiced with all my 3x3 cubes( I had three of the Rubix cubes) and I could remember all the steps to solve the cube except for the last step. It took the longest time and the last step was really hard to remember. So I am still stuck trying to solve the last step.
I couldn't solve the last step but my dad ordered 10 more cubes. They all are hard to solve but for 3 or 4 cubes I can solve the cubes but I can’t solve the last step like for the 3x3 cube but it is fun solving the cube. I have never timed myself to solve the cube because I can't solve the last step without the tutorial. 
I once tried timing myself with the tutorial and it took me 2 minutes and 43 seconds(that is my fastest time). The ten cubes were 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, mega mix, ivy cube, sweb cube(I don't know how to pronounce the name), mirror cube, pyrimad cube, and I forgot the name of the last cube. The cubes that are the most fun to solve are the  ivy cube, sweb cube,mirror cube, pyrimad cube, and mega mix. The 1x1 is really hard to solve. Know you might be saying that the 1x1 is already solved and there is no way to solve it but there is a way to solve it and it is really hard.
Solving little riddles is alway makes me happy.They are fun because I am eager to find the answer and I like to look for things that are challenging. I forgot the person who made the rubix cube. Rubix cubes are the best! I wish that I had all the rubix cubes so I could learn how to solve each and every one of them!
